# Hi there!

This is a git repo for a C# tutorial I'm doing with Code: You, a developer program here in Kentucky!

# How do I run it?

If you want to run it, just clone the repo. You'll probably need the .NET SDK. If you have Visual Studio installed with the .NET stuff, you're probably good. After that, you can press "run program" in the UI, or write this in the console:

```bash
dotnet build
```

That'll create the program for you, then do:

```bash
dotnet run --project "Pet Store"
```

That will run the project in your CLI!
